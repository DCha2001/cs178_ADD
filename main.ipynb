However, this light bulb shape cup is their trade mark, it will be difficult to change from unique shape. I would keep using it, because the cup is the differential from other boba place. \\n\\nI got the taro milk shake. The only thing I don't like is the use regular milk.

Each focal wall having something cute a quirky to capture a picturesque bubble tea shot. \\n\\nMenu consists of some basic tea variations and then goes into their more signature cheese teas. The cheese aspect is more of the addition of the cheesy froth topped onto the teas. Sounded super weird, but the salty froth mixed with the sweetened flavored teas go super well together. The one bizarre thing i\\'d point out is the one size aspect. Each drink being a minimum of $6.50 it\\'s one of the pricier places the go for bubble tea, and with that some of the teas actually come in smaller sized cups. Price might be the strongest deterrent to revisiting considering location and how pricey the drinks come up to, with how often I need bbt cravings curbed, cocoa and gongcha will still be my go to spots to not break the bank. \\n\\nCheese Strawberry Smoothie - ($7.00) - Super sweet, but I thoroughly enjoyed! This was on their \"Seasonal Tea\" category. \\n\\nCheese Golden Phoenix Tea - ($6.49) -  One of the smaller sized teas, this had a strong matcha taste to it and only subtly sweet the cheese was a lovely mix to it all.

Looking around the place, there's a small amount of seating area, but the decor is really cute and simple. White painted walls and wooden furniture mixed with flower adorned tables and numerous other hanging planters throughout 1, 2, Tea.  Off to the side they have a collection of board games you can play, and they also offer free WiFi. I was surprised by where they are located, but they are close enough to me that I do not mind. \\n\\nWhat I really love about this place is that you get a stronger taste of tea in their drinks. Even though milk teas are normally my go-to, I find myself ordering more of their fruit teas because they're made really well. \\n\\nNear the counter they have a 'top-10' list, which I think is really helpful. Their menu is still expanding, but it is not too overwhelming. However, I do wish they offered more than one size for their drinks. Furthermore, if you go within an hour or two of their closing, they might have run out of tapioca boba (this happened a couple of times to me). Nevertheless, they offer other yummy toppings, such as the coffee jelly, lychee jelly, and their adorable passionfruit, dolphin-shaped jelly! \\n\\nOverall, quality boba drinks, great service, inexpensive prices, mellow atmosphere, and open late on Friday and Saturday. They also have punch cards now, so make sure to ask for one on your next visit! I can't wait to return to try their food!\",\n",
       " \"Visited this spot for the first time. It competes well with the plethora of bubble tea places in Chinatown. I love their milk tea flavor the best compared to TeaDo, Vivi Tea, Miu Cha, Kungfu Tea etc. I can actually taste the black tea and it doesn't get overpowered by the milk. The setting is also very cute and instagramy. I got the Trio Milk Tea. I ordered it at 60% sugar but it was still too sweet for me...will try the next sugar level down next time. At other places I usually do the 75%/70% sugar and it's fine...so this place may add more sugar that other bubble tea spots?\",\n",

Being from Houston there's a wide variety of great boba tea places and I was curious to see if this new town had anything comparable. My first visit I was not impressed as the bob a was pretty hard and not cooked all the way in my oolong milk tea. After seeing all the reviews I decided to give them another shot. The second time I ordered a mango pineapple smoothie with boba and I could see what the reviews were referring to. The boba was perfect and the drink was your standard smoothie but not overly sweet. After the second time I decided to try it again! I ordered the oolong milk tea and seeing as the business has not been very busy with the pandemic, I was surprised to hear that they didn't have any boba and it would be another 25 minutes if I wanted it. Also, the cashier, though she was sweet, really struggled with the family in front of me and their order.\\n\\nOverall I gave this place a 4 out of 5 stars simply because it lacks consistency in whether or not it is good. I will say the service is quick and the people working there tend to be nice. In my three times visiting the business has never been busy inside but it is clean and they have a wide variety of options. If you don't like to get boba I will say their drinks are good however if you do tend to get boba in your drinks that's where there is inconsistency.\",\n",

This weekend, they were running a BOGO deal on certain menu items, and I decided to give it a try. On the first BOGO day, I ordered a mango and orange smoothie, and I ordered a milk tea with bubbles with less sugar. The mango and orange smoothie was refreshing and not overly sweet. I would order it again. The milk tea with bubbles, on the other hand, was awful. The milk tea tasted watered down, and based on the aftertaste, I suspect that they use some type of flavored coffee creamer. \\n\\nThe second day, my cousin and I ordered lychee lime green teas - the lime zest made the beverage a little bitter, but the tea was nice and strong. You don't get too much of a lychee flavor, but I enjoyed it overall. This place seems to be known more for their juices and fruity beverages, so if that is what you enjoy, I would recommend this place.\",\n",

The kiddie size scoop was about baseball size and plenty for a sweet treat. \\nI got the Kitty kitty bang bang which was Oreo, cheesecake and raspberry jelly with chunks of chocolate. It was sooo tasty. Most of the flavors were chocolate and raspberry. \\nMy husband got a Peanut butter pretzel flavor but can't remember the name. Yippy skippy maybe? It was equally as yummy as mine.

Even the cups still say Tea Talk on them. In my mind, the lack of changes is a plus because I was a huge fan of Tea Talk. \\n\\nThe main reason I come here is because the bubbles are consistent. They are tender and a little chewy. They are never undercooked or overcooked. The staff here is very friendly and has no problem letting you add extra things to your drink, remove things, or swap things out to customize it...bubbles, lychee jelly, aloe jelly, etc. \\n\\nThe new additions to the winter menu were quite tasty. I liked the hot rice drink. Unfortunately, they don't seem to have any seasonal additions for the summer yet. \\n\\nMy usual summer drink here is the blueberry green tea. It comes with lychee jelly. I also add bubbles to it for an extra 50 cents. They were out of blueberry this week, so I've been drinking the honey lime green tea. In the winter, I love the Japanese black bubble tea served hot. The texture of the bubbles isn't as good when warm, but it's still good on a cold day. None of the drinks I've had are overly sweet which is a plus. \\n\\nMy only complaint is that I wish they wouldn't have taken away the tables and chairs. The couches are comfy, but the wooden blocks are not. I feel like there is a lot less comfortable seating in here than there was, which is a problem when this place gets crowded. \\n\\nThe bathroom has been clean every time I have come here, which is necessary because I like to meet up here with people and hang out a while. \\n\\nI love Tea Chat!

Honestly, their drink is average to me, compare to other bubble tea places I have tried before.  I believe they are also expanding to having some snacks or cakes available in the near future as well.

The ahi tuna tasted good, but the portion was pretty small - the smallest I have ever seen in a poke bowl (which is why I can only give 4 stars). \\n\\nThe staff were wearing masks and gloves, and hand sanitizer was available at the register.

Sharetea's boba bubbles in comparison aren't bad, but just aren't as consistent or have as good flavor/texture as kung fu. \\n\\nIf you're looking for good boba in New Orleans, definitely come here.

So if it's not for the taro slush, I'd get anything else at kung fu tea (better tea with decent boba). \\n\\nParking is a little tight in the plaza but not too bad.

Based on the number of food delivery orders that streamed in and out during our visit, I think they have tapped a market which should help keep the lights on this time. \\n\\nWhile visiting, we ordered two real fruit boba. We had the avocado before but this time we also tried raspberry which was a really delight. We almost go the old reliable strawberry but I'm glad we didn't. I highly recommend it. \\n\\nHaving been happy with the sushi on a previous visit, we tried the tonkotsu ramen this time. At $13.50, I felt it was in line with other locations if not a little on the high side for what you get. It came with two halves of a marinated egg, fungus, bamboo and a few other garnishes.

I planned to just order and go, but it was too cute and happy to leave. I had to stay and sip my hot ginger tea latte right then and there. The tea, btw-absolutely divine. It smelled like birthday cupcakes and tasted like pure joy. I am a *fan!!!\\n\\nThis is my first time here-the first of what will be hundreds of visits. This is sooooo worth making a U-turn on S.R. 60 on a Saturday!!!! (and so few things are) I can't wait to come back and try everything on the menu (there are nibbles, too-please see the chalkboard menu pic) \\n\\nThanks, Annie's!!! See you soon!\",\n",
       " \"Whenever I go grocery shopping at Hmart or I'm dining/picking up take out from the nearby restaurants, I stop by S&P Boba Tea. \\n\\nI always order either a Thai Milk Tea or a Brown Sugar Milk Tea with Milk Foam. I'm not a fan of bitter teas, so I definitely like my milk teas on the sweeter side. If you like your already sweet drinks to be even sweeter, I'd recommend asking for extra milk in the Thai Milk Tea and extra brown sugar drizzle for the Brown Sugar Milk Tea! \\n\\nThe prices are pretty comparable to other boba places and they also have pretty much every combination and flavor you could ask for. All Milk Teas are $3.50 and the Brown Sugar Milk Tea with Milk Foam is $5. There is a surcharge for all payments with card. \\n\\nI would also recommend their red velvet chocolate chip & white chocolate chip cookies! So so good and only $1.\",\n",

One specific worker, whom I unfortunately don\\'t know the name of, always goes the extra mile. She\\'s always so sweet and helpful. I\\'m always sure to tip when she\\'s on shift.\\n\\nToday, I came in and ordered 3 drinks (throughout the course of the day) for my sister, friend and I. The cashier wasn\\'t the most friendly (hence the deducted 1 star). When I asked her a question, she replied in a slightly condescending, impatient tone. Maybe she had a rough day? It was more alarming because she was all smiles and laughs to her coworkers.\\n\\nThe bubble tea is always quality though. Everything tastes so fresh. I personally like the bubbles here a lot too.\\n\\nI will come back for sure, but I may be a bit more hesitant to ask questions from now on.\\n\\nOverall, great bubble tea place though! Check it out!\\n\\nI noticed slight improvements in the interior. I really appreciate the long opening hours and available outlets.',\n",
       " \"Swinterland satisfied me more than necessary. Really. \\n\\nIt has a nice atmosphere that's great for doing work, or just simply relaxing. Even the prices are nice and reasonable. Since it's near the IUPUI Campus, students can grab a quick bite to eat there, while studying for school. (There are laptops for you to use- for free!) Same for people who just want to sit down and chill for a little. \\n\\nI recommend the freshly made Mango Mountain, though you may want to share it with someone else. They give large portions, which is pretty nice! The snow ice part is very fluffy and soft, fulfilling my expectations completely. Also, the many snow ice selections are great for the weather we have been having lately- sunny and hot. \\n\\nThe best part is the milk tea, allowing you to pick how much sugar you prefer and the different flavors the boba offers. Adding only $0.25 to your milk tea, the boba is totally worth it. \\n\\nDid I mention free wifi? Everybody loves that. There are a bunch of games for everyone to play just for fun. Additionally, I have to mention their lights. They're pretty cool and they match the overall setting nicely. \\n\\nThe service was pleasing and the employees were  very nice to me. :)\\n\\nTo sum up, Swinterland is the ideal hang out place to eat desserts. I will definitely come back soon!\",\n",

Service was fast enough.\\n\\nI got a large iced Passion Fruit ($5.83/each), really been into fruit teas lately, saw that they had Ginger after I ordered or else I would've gotten that.The tapioca pearls were a little slimy for me, not as firm as I'm used to or preference. \\n\\nThe Matcha Tea tasted like it was lower quality compared to other ones I've had, wish they'd invest in higher quality, but it was a good choice to offset after getting an Oreo Milkshake from Steak & Shake, which was sugary.\\n\\nI loved that I got to choose my own colored straw from a rainbow selection. I know it's a small thing, but I liked that! I noticed the small things and it makes me happy!\\n\\nThey have Milk, Fruit, Special and Customizable boba teas to choose from. There's a chalkboard showing the evolution of how the  complicated formulas came to fruition in creating their drinks, which is a total gimmick, but I'm in Sales, so I fell for it and liked it. ;-)\",\n",

This item look like Cuban pastry but with oriental seasoning meat in fill. It is delicious. The pastry crust also very good. I recommend this dish. \\n\\nThe drink is good because they give close 20 drink. Price wise is about $.50 cheaper than most. I got the coconut slush with grass jelly. The grass jelly was did a good job. Soft and jelly. \\n\\nThe banh mi is below average. The bun was to tough to bite. I think it need to be toasted for easy bite. Seem like the bun was sit there some time. We got the special combination banh mi and grilled pork banh mi. One compliment can give is the grey paste did a good job. The meat for special and grilled pork are just average.',\n",

       " \"Cube Tea is passable for St. Louis standards. But any of the large bubble tea chains or franchises like Kung Fu Tea or Sharetea has better drinks. Their menus are paper menus on clipboards, which gives off a cheap impression. Their drinks are expensive for the size of their cups. I paid over $5 for a cup of milk tea that looked like it was barely eight ounces. \\n\\nI had the jade black milk tea. It tasted watered down like my ice melted as soon as I got my drink handed to me. Also Cube Tea has a problem where its drinks aren't sweet enough-completely opposite of the usual problem of bubble tea stores having drinks that are too sweet. \\n\\nCube Tea is right next to the Asian market. Cube Tea could easily be mistaken as a part of the Asian Market given that it's right next to the entrance of the Asian market. No tables or anywhere to sit.\",\n",

I will definitely order it from here again. My vermicelli noodles were a little too wet for my taste, I like them to be more dry so when I add my sauce,  it doesn't turn to soup.

Although some of the flavors are quite sweet I typically stick with taro or matcha which is typically not too sweet or artificial tasting.

The Matcha Maker is a mix of matcha, hibiscus and strawberry milk! I wish the matcha was more prominent; however i still very much liked it! The Coat and Thai was a very comforting drink! It was a Thai milk tea with a butterscotch cheese cream! It was very Fall and holiday-like!  I love how they have monthly specials!\\n\\nLove the drinks; however if you dont like very sweet drinks, be sure to adjust the sweetness level of their specialty drinks! They tend to be very sweet and usually the cashier does not ask if you want to adjust the sweetness level! Overall i love this place!',\n",

The Florida roll tasted amazing with the mango on it but had way too much sauce on top of it to where I couldn't even taste the fish or inside. I also ordered a papaya boba tea but the papaya flavor tasted a bit off or powdery. Next time I'll try avocado, or a more subtle flavor. The waitress was really nice and attentive.\",\n",
       " \"Popped into Quickly on a Friday night and while it was fairly busy, it seemed quite disorganized and chaotic behind the counter. Our order was taken relatively quickly but after that, it was a bit of a waiting game. We also just managed to beat the rush as the line snaked all the way to the door by the time we left - our total time from ordering to leaving with to go drinks was 40-ish mins. They only made one of our drinks and had problems matching drinks up with customers. I got asked a few times if x drink for x name was mine. I don't think the method of taking names really worked - it may be better if they had out numbers instead. They were quite apologetic when we asked where our second drink was and made it right away on the fly, but there was definitely some communication issues. My salted milk froth tea was fine but it didn't have a lot of salt or really much flavour in general - I do prefer the version at Gama Cafe more. \\n\\nI am chalking this experience up to new opening issues and will probably go back and check them out in the future.\",\n",

Not sure if this is a bad franchise, the location or staff member but this experience left a bad taste in my mouth.\",\n",

There wasn't much interaction with the cashier but my drink did come out pretty fast. This franchise is located inside the H-Mart food court  so I don't really expect a whole conversation so all is good here!\",\n",

However, when I saw how long the lines were each day and how crowded it was inside I decided to just wait. \\nSo, officially today is their day 6 of the business. The line was still long, and the service was pretty slow. I am not counting this against them since the employees still have to get used to making drinks, and facing different glitches. I definitely want to support this business because it is Philly based! \\nI ordered taro milk tea (30% sugar, and with lactaid milk), and oolong milk tea with boba (25% sugar, and lactaid milk). Taro milk tea tastes very good! I think I can go lower in sugar, and oolong the same way (can go with less sugar next time). \\nI will definitely come back again to see how things are going here. There are other drinks I want to try also.',\n",

I had the jasmine potted milk foam milk tea cause I love jasmine milk tea, but it was not what I expected at all! The cashier said it was like a honey jasmine tea on the bottom with like a salty milk foam on top. I tasted the tea before stirring it up and thought it was super refreshing. I thought the top foam was a little too much in comparison to the amount of honey jasmine tea. I thought the foam covered up the taste of the tea after I mixed it up. I tasted more of the salty milk foam rather than the tea at that point. If the foam was a little less rich, then I think I would've given it a 5 star. I'll definitely stop by here again when I visit Nashville and try other drinks though. It's a very cute tiny bubble tea/food place.\",\n",

The process from cream to bowl was intriguing as the owner mixed in ingredients of my choice and rolled the frozen delicacy into 5  frozen scrolls and placed them into my cup.  My toppings of choice were fresh fruit and M&M's all blanketed with a layer of chocolate sauce.\\nI hope that Chesterfield gives this place a chance.

We got 2 large boba drinks. One was taro and the other one had strawberry or some berry taste. \\n\\nBoth were ok, but it was just more sugar than flavor. Then there's the boba, which is the signature part of the drink. But they were hard and overly chewy.

It tasted more like a hint of mango and had a deep tea flavor. Next time I ordered this mango slushee drink with bubbles. It tasted pretty much the same as the mango green tea except with crushed ice. I thought it would be more slushee like, but it was pretty much just a drink with lots of small pieces of ice. Their tapioca bubbles are also tinier than I'm used to, but that's not the end of the world, just different.\\n\\nIt's also a pretty location and if COVID wasn't a thing, it might be a nice place to sit in and study or meet with friends.

The reviews are pretty amazing, but I\\'m not in Pinellas Park very often, so I figured she\\'d be able to enjoy it before I would. Fortunately, we actually happened to be in the area, so we stopped by and I\\'m completely in love after one visit. \\n\\nAt first, my wife just had me run inside and order a taro boba for her. I planned on grabbing a couple drinks to go and heading home, but I saw the waffle ice cream concoctions on the menu and thought that it would be much better to eat-in. Every waffle looked amazing, but the \\n\"Rainbow In My Hand\" with cotton candy ice cream, gummies and mochi\\'s really caught my eye.\\n\\nThe saying \"explosion of flavor\" is cliche, but I don\\'t know any other more accurate way to describe this. You got creamy, sour, sweet, mushy, hard and dense in every bite. It\\'s quite a lot for your taste buds to process, but I liked it. With that being said, I\\'d opt for something like the Cookielicious or the Snow White next time, just for a bit more continuity.\\n\\nAlso, my coconut boba smoothie and her taro milk tea were both top notch.\\n\\nBut then as we were leaving, my wife pointed out a sign off to the side that showed ice cream boba\\'s. And I have to tell you, outside of a sign that said, \"Brett, you\\'ve won a new car,\" I don\\'t know if I could have been happier to see that particular set of information.\\n\\nI\\'d recently been introduced to ice cream boba\\'s in San Francisco and fell head over heels in love. I was told that they only recently made their way to the United States and were super hard to find. I knew that probably meant I wouldn\\'t find them in Tampa Bay until about 2024, when they\\'d be old news in SF. So to find them about 3 weeks later in Pinellas Park, I was ecstatic. \\n\\nI\\'d already had a small dessert before arriving at Moonlight Boba + ordered a boba smoothie and an ice cream waffle here. I wanted to fully enjoy this ice cream boba, so we hopped in the car, drove about 40 minutes home to Tampa, froze them and ate them the next day. They were still just as unbelievable as I remembered, despite nearly melting away in the car the day before. Do yourself the greatest favor and go to Moonlight Boba for many things, but especially for the ice cream boba\\'s before they sell out!\\n\\nAs I said, we aren\\'t in Pinellas Park often, but if timing/circumstances work out, I know exactly where I\\'m coming for my sweet fix.',\n",

Fried Chicken is a little too salty for me but it has crunchy skin and juicy inside.  The fried sweet potato is good, so is the pepper side dish; the biscuit is kind of dry and hard.  Overall, I think it's about the same quality as popeyes but more expensive.  Service is good.  \\n\\nOverall, I will probably go for Kung Fu Tea but not the chicken.\",\n",
       " \"Out of all the boba places I've tried in Philly since I came two months ago, A Cup Of Tea is definitely one of my favorites. \\n\\nIf you decide to get milk tea, try the roast oolong! I tried it for the first time and it's an interesting take on regular oolong milk tea that brings out more complexity in the flavors in your mouth. I would definitely recommend!\\n\\nAnother tip is to get normal or little less sugar level! I've been traumatized with life threatening high levels of sugar at other boba places but A Cup Of Tea is the only place that stays true to their sugar levels.\\n\\nOverall, I would definitely recommend coming to try this boba place. Although it's a bit far off from the main part of Chinatown, the amazing boba here makes it all worth the trek!\"]"
